# RobotGame_Fuels-Mines
In the robot competition, two robots designed by students compete head to head on a virtual map containing fuel and explosives.

 My code is in myRobot.m
 
The game ends when both robots reach a range of five units from each other -  at this point, the robot with more fuel will be declared the winner.
○ In each step of the game, the robot must decide in which direction to move and how far.
○ In each turn, the robot loses fuel as a function of the distance it moves.
○ If the robot reaches a fuel tank, the robot's fuel amount increases according to the amount of fuel in the tank.
○ If the robot reaches an explosive, the robot's fuel amount decreases.
